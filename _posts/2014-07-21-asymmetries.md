Abstract:
Most Americans support liberal policies on the social welfare agenda, the dominant policy cleavage in American politics. Yet, a striking feature of the American party system is its tendency to equilibrium. How, then, does the Republican Party minimize defection? There is, our results show, a deep ideological asymmetry between the parties. Republican identifiers are ideologically aware and oriented to a degree that far exceeds their Democratic counterparts. Our investigation, which utilizes cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental data, demonstrates the role of ideological awareness and involvement in Republicans ability to onto the backing of their supporters even on issues on which the position of the Democratic Party is widely popular.  It also exposes two mechanisms, party branding and the use of the status quo as a focal point, by which Democrats retain or rally support on issues on which the position of the Republican Party is widely popular.
