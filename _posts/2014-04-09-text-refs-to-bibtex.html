<p>I wanted to import all the refs from an article into my bibtex library. This tool made it pretty easy:Â <a title="This tool made it easy." href="http://text2bib.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/convert">http://text2bib.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/convert</a>. I just copy-pasted the refs from the fulltext of the article I was reading. Removed quotation marks, and that was pretty much it.</p>
