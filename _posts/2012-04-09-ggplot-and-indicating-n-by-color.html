<p>I don't know if it's an original idea or not.</p>
<p>But for a paper I'm working on with Jon Krosnick, we plotted the number of times a respondent voted in the past 10 years by the their stated likelihood of voting in the upcoming election across a variety of different scales. We wanted to indicate the number of respondents that used each response option (on the x-axis.) One possibility would to use a <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/geom_rug.html">rug plot</a>, but there's already a lot going on in these graphs. What we came up with--and we may be reinventing the wheel--was to use a color gradient to indicate N, with darker colors meaning more people used that response option. The result looked something like this:</p>
