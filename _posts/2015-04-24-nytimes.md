title: Asymmetry work in the nytimes
---
[Tom Edsall](http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/profile/35-thomas-b-edsall/10) discussed my work with Paul Sniderman on asymmetry in ideology in his [nytimes column](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/opinion/obamacare-hands-off-my-medicare.html?_r=0). Namely, he discusses America's aversion--especially among Republicans--for particularistic policies.
