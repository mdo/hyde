title: Political Knowledge- Not worse than other knowledge
---

Democratic rule requires a certain level of political knowledge. 60 years of research indicates we are lacking it. In a [working paper](http://paperroom.ipsa.org/app/webroot/papers/paper_25068.pdf), [Crag Burnett](http://people.uncw.edu/burnettc/) and [Matt McCubbins](http://www.mccubbins.us/) show people know only slightly more about rules of the road and less about sports, popular culture, geography. Not sure if this is an optimistic story or not.
