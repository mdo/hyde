<img align="right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/ylelkes_01.jpeg"> I  am Assistant Professor of Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam. In September 2016, I will be joining the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. 

My primary focus is on the role of the political information environment in structuring attitudes and beliefs. For instance, I've looked at ways in which broadband access affects polarization, and am now looking at ways in which highspeed Internet impacts social capital and political knowledge.

I received my PhD in Communication (with a minor in psychology) from Stanford University, an MA in Political Science from Temple University, and a B.A. in Political Science and Journalism and Mass Communication from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.
My research has appeared or is forthcoming in various journals across disciplines, including the American Journal of Political Science, the Journal of Politics, PNAS, British Journal of Political Science, Public Opinion Quarterly, Political Psychology, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.
