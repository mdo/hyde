<img align="right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/ylelkes_01.jpeg"> I  am Assistant Professor of Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam. 

My main focus is on the role of the political information enviroment in structuring attitudes. Some relevant work includes a [comparative analysis of the effects of partisan news on institutional trust](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/workingpapers/lelkespolpar.pdf), a number of articles exploring the connection between elite communication and political attitudes and identities, e.g.,[1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/published/Malka-et-al.-2012-Political-Psychology-2.pdf),[2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/articles/Malka-Soto-Inzlicht-Lelkes-in%20press-JPSP.pdf).

I also study (mostly American) public opinion, with a particular interest in polarization (e.g., [1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/published/Public%20Opin%20Q-2012-Iyengar-poq_nfs038.pdf),[2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/workingpapers/naturelimits.pdf)), and asymmetries between Republicans and Democrats (e.g.,[1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/workingpapers/ideo_asym.pdf)).

I received my PhD in Communication (with a minor in psychology) from Stanford University, an MA in Political Science from Temple University, and a B.A. in Political Science and Journalism and Mass Communication from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.
My research has appeared or is forthcoming in various journals across disciplines, including the American Journal of Political Science, PNAS, British Journal of Political Science, Public Opinion Quarterly, Political Psychology, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.
