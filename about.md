<img align="right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42416194/ylelkes_01.jpeg"> I  am Assistant Professor of Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam. My research focuses on the intersection of Communication, Psychology, and Political Science. My main focus is on the role of the political information enviroment in structuring attitudes. Recent topics include: polarization and its relationship to political communication, partisan asymmetries in political attitudes, and ideological and religious identities. In addition, I study ways in which we can improve survey and experimental design and measurement. 

I received my PhD in Communication (with a minor in psychology) from Stanford University, an MA in Political Science from Temple University, and a B.A. in Political Science and Journalism and Mass Communication from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.
My research has appeared or is forthcoming in various journals across disciplines, including PNAS, Public Opinion Quarterly, Political Psychology, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.
